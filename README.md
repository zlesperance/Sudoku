A Sudoku Generator Built in JavaScript

The generation algorithm will generate a random valid solution, 
then remove numbers until there are only 20 to 30 number "hints"
remaining.

To Do:

Currently the generator checks for solvability using basic solving methods.
There should be more complex solving algorithms built in, then the difficulty
of the generated puzzle could be determined by the difficulty of the methods
used to solve it.
